# COMP Lab Coursework Repository

## 📌 Introduction
This repository contains my undergraduate coursework for selected COMP lab courses at **Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU)** and **McGill University** during my exchange program. The purpose of this repository is twofold:

1. 📝 To keep track of my learning and progress in computer science.
2. 📚 To serve as a reference for fellow students who are taking similar courses in the future.

📖 Additionally, I have also saved **lecture notes** and **syllabus** from these courses. If you need them, feel free to email me at **alvinfengfei@gmail.com** to request access. 

💬 I am also very interested in discussing my undergraduate study plan and any related topics with you!
